<h1 align="Left">Hi, I'm Iggy 👋</h1>
 
- I am a **mechatronics engineer** with a BSc from Monash University Malaysia, and I do firmware development for work.
- My mission is to become the best engineer I can be, as it's my duty to this world.
- When free, I enjoy tinkering with microcontrollers and programming in languages such as C, Python and JavaScript and more recently, Rust.
- I am deeply passionate in embedded engineering and electronics, specifically wearables and IoT connected devices (I spend _way_ too much on dev kits!).

- Currently learning:
  - 🦀 _Rust_, for developing future-proof and secure firmware for IoT devices.
  - 🇩🇪 _German_, as I am fond of their culture, history and ideas. 

- My hobbies:
  - 🕸️ Frontend web development with _Svelte_.
  - 💻 Designing and prototyping PCBs in _KiCAD_, for personal projects.
  - 🕺 Locking dance.
  - 🐶 Spoiling my mischievous puppy, Nala.
  
I'm looking for **interesting _and_ stimulating** work opportunities.

Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or (soon™️) on my website!
